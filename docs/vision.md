# Vision

## Goal

The objective is to build **a persistent layer for human reasoning** —  
where arguments do not vanish, but evolve, connect, and compound.

The system is not here to decide what is correct;  
it exists to **organize how ideas develop over time**.

## Recursive structure

- Every claim can become a new debate
- Debates branch, deepen, and reference each other
- Reasoning becomes **navigable and multi-layered**
- Nothing is lost — thought becomes **continuity**

## Process of refinement

Over time:

- Some lines of reasoning gain strength
- Others fade or remain unresolved
- Disagreements become structured, not noisy
- Progress is measured by **clarity and connection**, not volume

The goal is not to close discussion but to **map its evolution**.

## Possible extensions

These are **possible future layers**, not required for the core system:

### Debate → Prediction layer
For debates tied to real future outcomes:
- A debate can convert into a prediction market
- With a defined resolution date

### Resolution by credible contributors
Resolution can be informed by participants who:
- Have demonstrated reliability through consistent contributions
- Show domain expertise through their accumulated triples
- Are trusted via network relationships

Oracles **emerge from the graph**, not by appointment.

### Cognitive identity & agent support
Over time, the system can support:

- Personal reasoning profiles
- Navigation based on your logic style
- AI that understands how you think, not just what you type
- Memory of positions, arguments, and evolution

The platform can become a layer of **cognitive identity**, not just a discussion space.

## Ambition

1. Structure reasoning  
2. Preserve and connect arguments  
3. Enable exploration and reuse  
4. Let ideas evolve instead of reset  
5. Surface reliability and expertise naturally  
6. Add predictive and incentive layers when meaningful  
7. Support intelligent agents that operate on structured thought  

A system where **thinking does not vanish — it compounds.**
