# Overview â€” Debate Market

## Why

Online debates typically vanish into feeds, repeat endlessly, and do not accumulate shared understanding.  
Nothing is structured, nothing persists, and nothing improves collectively.

This system proposes a different model: **turn debate into structured, reusable reasoning.**  
Each contribution enriches a shared memory rather than disappearing.

---

## Core concept

- A debate starts with a **clear assertion**
- Participants add claims **for** or **against**
- A debate can also be opened **without taking a position** at first
- **Each claim = a triple on-chain** (Subject â†’ Relation â†’ Object)
- Any claim can become the starting point for a new debate
- Reasoning grows **recursively**, not linearly

---

## User experience

Users see:

- The initial assertion
- For-claims and against-claims
- Deeper levels of responses and justifications
- A structured reasoning map rather than a scrolling feed

The interface encourages clarity and connection, not reaction.

---

## How it works

- A claim is directly stored **as a triple**
- The system records relationships of meaning, not just text
- Arguments accumulate and connect across debates
- The result is a shared, navigable memory of reasoning

Debate becomes **a growing structure of thought**, not an ephemeral thread.

---

## Contribution modes

### Manual mode
Write claims directly and assign them as **for** or **against**.

### Assisted mode
Write naturally; the system helps transform free text into structured claims:

1. User types an argument in natural language  
2. The assistant extracts proposed claims and positions (for/against)  
3. The user reviews, edits, approves, or rejects each suggestion  
4. Approved claims are saved as triples  

The assistant helps organize thoughts â€” **the human remains the decision-maker**.

---

## What this enables

- Reuse of arguments across debates
- Accumulation of reasoning instead of repeating it
- Visibility on how ideas develop over time
- Emergence of stable reasoning paths or abandoned ones
- Debate becomes **a tool for building knowledge**, not just expressing opinion
