# Overview â€” Debate Market

## Why this exists

Online debate today dissolves into feeds and comments.  
Ideas crash, scatter, and disappear.  
Nothing compounds into understanding.

This project proposes a different model:

**Debate becomes structured reasoning that persists, learns, and grows.**

Every contribution becomes a piece of knowledge, not a passing message.

---

## Core mechanic

A debate begins with a **clear assertion**.  
Participants then add claims that are:

- **For**
- **Against**

Each contribution must take a stance and justify it.

No isolated comments. Every statement enters a reasoning structure.

And any claim can itself become the root of a new debate, allowing reasoning to unfold recursively.

This creates **branching, navigable thought**, not linear argument threads.

---

## How it appears to users

Users see:

- a starting assertion
- supporting claims
- opposing claims
- deeper layers of argument and counter-argument

A map of thinking, not a pile of reactions.

---

## How it works underneath

Each claim becomes a node recorded on Intuition, connected to prior reasoning.

The result:

- arguments persist,
- logic becomes navigable,
- insights accumulate rather than reset.

Debate turns into **public cognitive memory**.

---

## Contributing

Two modes:

- **Manual** â€” articulate claims directly
- **Assisted** â€” write freely; an agent extracts and structures claims (user verifies)

Human judgment stays central.  
The system simply provides structure.

---

## What this unlocks

This model enables:

- reusable arguments across topics
- visible evolution of ideas
- collective refinement instead of repetition
- emergence of stable lines of thought

Debate shifts from expression to **knowledge construction**.

## One more thingâ€¦

Those who support strong arguments early may later be rewarded through the protocolâ€™s incentive mechanisms.

But the order is intentional:

**Reason first.  
Structure first.  
Truth emerging over time.  
And only then â€” reward for early clarity and conviction.**
