# Overview

Imagine an interface where you can start **any debate you want**.

Not just voting *yes* or *no*.  
Not throwing opinions into a social feed that disappears tomorrow.

No.

A place where you can:

- make a clear claim  
- explain **why** you believe it  
- connect arguments together  
- and **stake** to show conviction  

A space where ideas are not only expressed,  
but **weighted**, **challenged**, **mapped**, and **remembered**.

## 🌐 An on-chain debate market

In this interface, debate isn’t noise or ego warfare.

It’s an **on-chain market for arguments**.

- Every position becomes a **claim**  
- Every justification becomes a **relation**  
- Every stake becomes a **signal of belief**  
- Every contribution builds a **living knowledge layer**

Here, the question is no longer:

> Who speaks the loudest?

But instead:

> Who is right — and who is willing to stand behind it?

This is not a vote.  
This is not a like.  
It is **skin in the game**.

Ideas earn credibility through **reason + economic backing**,  
not virality or volume.

## 🧠 Knowledge becomes structure

In this system, arguments don’t vanish in a feed.

They become **structured knowledge**:

- Each argument = a verifiable node  
- Each link = meaning and context  
- Each stake = conviction in the open  
- The network = a collective map of truth, uncertainty, and challenge  

The more people test, refine, and stress an idea,  
the more it finds its place in a **shared understanding of the world**.

## 🎯 Today: the Debate Market

We start with:

- ✅ launching debates  
- ✅ structuring arguments  
- ✅ staking to signal conviction  
- ✅ watching the strongest reasoning rise  
- ✅ building a public, trust-weighted knowledge layer  

No oracle.  
No prediction markets.  
No automated resolution.

Just **reasoning + conviction**, tracked on-chain.

## 🔮 Tomorrow: prediction + emergent oracles

But imagine what comes next.

Some debates point to the future.  
Some claims can *become* prediction markets.  
Their outcomes could be resolved not by a central authority,  
but by **oracles who emerge naturally from the graph** —  
people whose accuracy has been **demonstrated over time**.

A truth economy, where trust is **earned**,  
based on arguments that stood up,  
insights proven early,  
and beliefs backed publicly.

## 🪄 In one line

> A space where debate isn’t performance —  
> it’s knowledge construction.  
> Where you don’t just speak —  
> **you stand behind your ideas.**  
> And where truth can eventually be  
> **predicted, weighted, and verified**  
> by a collective intelligence encoded on-chain.

Welcome to the **Debate Market**.  
The first on-chain market for reasoning.

## 🧯 One more thing…

And yes —  
one day, when your ideas prove right  
and your conviction pays off…

> **you can actually earn money.**  
> *(via Intuition’s incentive layer)*

Not for shouting the loudest —  
but for **being right early and proving it**.
