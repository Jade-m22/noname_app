# Overview — Debate Market

## Introduction

The **Debate Market** proposes a new way to conduct debates online:  
not as fleeting exchanges or social content, but as **structured knowledge**.

Today, most debates:

- happen in isolated threads,
- disappear in feeds,
- rely on popularity dynamics,
- and produce no cumulative insight.

This system aims to reverse that pattern.

Here, every contribution becomes:

- a **claim** — a structured statement,
- linked to other claims through explicit **logical relationships**,
- recorded in a persistent, shared **knowledge network**.

Instead of debating into the void, participants **construct a growing reasoning graph**.

---

## Core Idea

A debate begins with a **central question or proposition**.  
Participants contribute positions, justifications, objections, refinements, and references.

Each element is recorded as a **claim**, and linked to others using explicit relationships such as:

- supports
- opposes
- qualifies
- depends on
- contradicts
- clarifies

This transforms debates from free-form opinion streams into **composable reasoning structures**.

The goal is not simply to “express a viewpoint”,  
but to **build a persistent map of arguments and counter-arguments**.

---

## Representation Model

### Human-readable structure

Debates are first displayed in a **clear logical structure**:

- Central claim → supporting arguments, opposing arguments, nuances, counterpoints.
- Users navigate layers of reasoning, not chaotic comment chains.
- Every contribution is anchored to a specific logical function.

This offers the clarity of well-moderated debate platforms,  
but with the rigor of formalized thought.

### Graph representation (on-chain knowledge)

Once recorded, these elements form a **knowledge graph** where:

- each claim becomes a node,
- each relation becomes an explicit edge,
- claims can be **reused across multiple debates**,
- the network grows as reasoning compounds.

Rather than disappearing, debates **accumulate into a shared memory of logic and justification**.

This enables:

- reasoning reuse,
- knowledge propagation,
- long-term analysis of ideas,
- and interoperability with computational systems (e.g., AI agents).

---

## Why this matters

This approach allows us to:

- **preserve debates** instead of losing them,
- **reduce duplication** across discussions,
- **locate true points of disagreement**,
- **identify converging or emerging consensus**,
- **make reasoning machine-navigable**,
- and **build a collective knowledge base over time**.

In short:  
debate becomes **a construction process**, not a performance or a content flow.

---

## Interaction Modes (Under Exploration)

Two methods of contribution are currently being evaluated:

### Manual structured mode

Users directly create:

- a claim,
- its classification (support, oppose, nuance…),
- and its relationships to existing claims.

This mode prioritizes **precision and expert control**,  
suited for analytical users, researchers, and power-contributors.

### Assisted mode (agent-aided)

Users write natural language arguments.  
An agent extracts:

- claims,
- relationships,
- and suggested structure.

The user then **reviews, edits, deletes, or confirms** the suggestions before recording.

This preserves **accessibility and expressiveness**,  
while maintaining structure and rigor.

Human judgment remains central; the agent accelerates the workflow.

---

## Future Direction

The current focus is on:

- argument modeling,
- long-term knowledge accumulation,
- and enabling structured, durable reasoning.

In later stages, debates tied to future-verifiable outcomes may:

- be monitored over time,
- incorporate resolution mechanisms,
- and explore incentive or confidence layers.

For now, the priority is **building the reasoning layer first** —  
a durable foundation for collective intelligence.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
Claim | A structured statement that can be debated or connected to other ideas. |
Relation | A logical link between claims (e.g., supports, refutes, qualifies). |
Triple | Formal statement structure: *Subject → Relation → Object*. |
Knowledge graph | Network of claims and relationships that can be reused and expanded. |
Argument structure | Organized representation of positions, counterpoints, and justification. |
Assisted agent | AI system helping extract and propose claims/relations from natural language. |
User validation | Human review and approval before final on-chain recording. |

---

### Summary

The Debate Market transforms debates into **persistent, structured, linkable knowledge**.  
Arguments do not vanish — they **compose**, **accumulate**, and **strengthen** over time,  
forming an evolving architecture of reasoning shared across users and systems.
