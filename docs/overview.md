# Overview — Debate Market

## Introduction

Most online debate today dissolves into the feed.

Arguments appear in threads, videos, comments, or chats, then vanish.  
Strong ideas are forgotten.  
Weak ideas reappear endlessly.  
There is no memory, no accumulation, no refinement.

This project takes a different approach:  
**turn debate into durable, structured knowledge.**

Instead of opinions floating through timelines, each contribution becomes:

- a clear, structured claim,
- linked logically to other ideas,
- recorded on-chain,
- integrated into the Intuition graph.

The goal is not simply to speak —  
but to **build a persistent memory of reasoning.**

---

## Core Concept

A debate begins with a **proposition**.

Participants can then contribute:

- supporting arguments,
- objections,
- nuance,
- conditional framing,
- counterexamples,
- references or evidence.

Every position must be **justified**.  
No binary “yes/no” without explanation —  
every stance becomes an argument with reasoning.

Each justification is turned into a **claim**,  
and each logical relation (*supports*, *refutes*, *qualifies*, etc.) is recorded as a **triple** on Intuition.

We transform:

- a discussion into a **network of ideas**,  
- an argument into a **verifiable knowledge element**,  
- an opinion into a **traceable reasoning unit**.

## Representation

### Human-facing structure

The debate interface presents a clear hierarchy of reasoning:

- central idea,
- supporting points,
- opposing points,
- nuance and rebuttals,
- contextual clarifications.

The experience mirrors natural debate logic —  
you assert, justify, challenge, and respond.

Its purpose is **clarity and intellectual discipline**,  
not virality or noise.

### On-chain knowledge graph

Once recorded on-chain:

- each claim becomes a node,
- each logical relation becomes an explicit edge,
- arguments can be reused across new debates,
- the network grows as reasoning compounds over time.

This produces **long-lived, navigable, composable knowledge**,  
instead of disappearing discussions.

The debate no longer ends when people stop talking —  
it **persists, evolves, and strengthens**.

## How Claims Are Generated

Two contribution modes are being explored:

### 1. Manual input

Users directly create claims and define their relationships.

- full precision
- transparent logic
- ideal for advanced contributors and researchers

### 2. Assisted extraction (AI-supported)

Users write in natural language.  
An agent extracts:

- individual claims,
- their orientation (support / oppose / nuance),
- suggested logical links.

The user **reviews, edits, and confirms** before recording.

The agent helps formalize thought,  
while **the human remains the final authority**.

This brings structure without sacrificing accessibility.

## Why This Matters

This approach enables us to:

- **preserve arguments** rather than lose them,
- **reuse and refine reasoning** rather than repeat it,
- **identify recurring patterns** across debates,
- **locate real points of disagreement**, not just reactions,
- **distinguish robust arguments from weak ones** over time,
- **build a public reasoning graph**,
- and make human logic **machine-navigable and analyzable**.

In short:

> Debate stops being consumption.  
> It becomes **knowledge construction**.

Instead of information decay, we get **cognitive accumulation**.

This is a shift from debate as entertainment  
to debate as **infrastructure for collective intelligence**.

---

## Vision

The initial phase builds the **reasoning and memory layer**.

As debates accumulate:

- themes emerge,
- strong ideas gain stability,
- weak ones erode or get replaced,
- consistent, rigorous thinkers stand out,
- collective understanding deepens.

Later phases may introduce:

- connection to real-world outcomes,
- validation and resolution mechanisms,
- incentives for epistemic rigor,
- emergent “oracles” — contributors whose reasoning repeatedly proves reliable,
- and eventually, optional predictive and economic layers.

But first:  
**structure the thinking.**

Before prediction, we need comprehension.  
Before incentives, we need logic.  
Before automation, we need formalization.

This layer is that foundation.
